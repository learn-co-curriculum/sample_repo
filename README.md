# Git: Working with Local Branches

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrate the primary role of branching
- Demonstrate creating a branch
- Demonstrate adding and committing changes
- Demonstrate pushing branches

## Introduction

We're faced with many choices in life; some of these choices are easier, more
convenient, or "safer" than others.

Consider a computer upgrade. We have the option of buying a new computer, a used
computer, or maybe there's nothing "wrong" with our current computer&mdash;we
want more storage space.

The cheapest option is most likely to buy compatible new parts for our existing
computer. However, we've never attempted tinkering with hardware in our computer
before, and after buying all the tools and parts, we follow an instructional
video to make the upgrades. In this case, we only have one computer to work on,
and nowhere to test out opening up a computer and connecting new parts. We have
to be careful not to damage anything else that makes the computer work.

It would be nice if we could test out our computer upgrading skills first.
Luckily, we _do_ have this option when coding!

If we had an identical computer that we could experiment, we could worry less
about making any mistakes that could impact our working machine. This is the
exact concept of branching.

## Demonstrate the Primary Role of Branching

I made a change here.

## Demonstrate Creating a Branch

## Demonstrate Adding and Committing Changes

## Demonstrate Pushing Branches

## Conclusion

Branching allows developers to make edits to a code base while isolating their
work from other work. We can create branches, back them up to remote locations,
and continue to work with them locally. It's a standard practice to have a
system in place for managing different versions of the same code base. It allows
us to have a "safe space" for making edits without affecting the primary code
base.
